## Homework

Each weekly Homework assignment has its own PDF (links below).  Homework is due at 11:59pm on the date listed.  See the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf) for due dates.

Please upload your Homework as a single PDF using Gradescope at the [Canvas page](FIXME).  Please follow the order and labeling of problems on the assignment.  See [this Calculus II Tech Help page](https://bueler.github.io/calc2/techHelp.html) for scanning/uploading advice.

FIXME The problems from the textbook will be graded for completion.

FIXME The "P" problems on each assignment will be graded for correctness.  Solutions to these problems will be posted at the [Modules tab on the Canvas page](FIXME) after the Homework assignment is due.
