## Homework Assignments

Our nearly-weekly homework Assignments each have their own PDF (links below).  Assignments are **due at the start of class**; see also the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf) for sections and due dates.

Please turn in each Assignment on paper, stapled in the upper-left corner, and with your name on the upper-right corner.  Also, please clearly indicate "Assignment X" as the title.
