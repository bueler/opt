## Homework Assignments

Our nearly-weekly homework Assignments each have their own PDF (links below).  Assignments are **due at the start of class**; see also the [Schedule](assets/general/F24/schedule.pdf) for sections and due dates.

Please turn in each Assignment on paper, stapled in the upper-left corner, and with your name on the upper-right corner.  Also, please clearly indicate "Assignment X" as the title.

After each Assignment is due, complete solutions will be posted at the **Modules tab** of the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/21663).
