## Homework

Our nearly-weekly homework assignments each have their own PDF (links below).  Homework is **due at the start of class**.  See the [Schedule](assets/general/schedule.pdf) for due dates.

Please turn in your Homework as a single, on-paper document, stapled in the upper-left corner and with your name on the upper-right corner.  Also, please clearly indicate "Assignment X" as the title.
