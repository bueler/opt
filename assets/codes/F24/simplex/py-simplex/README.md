# py-simplex/

These Python3 codes are by Kaelin Ellis.  They are a close Python3 rewrite of the Matlab/Octave versions.

## run examples

To run the book's example, first using the standard form and then the "EZ" form, do:

    $ python3 simplex_test.py

The output is the same as running `bookexSF.m` and `bookexEZ.m`.

Run the $n=5$ Klee-Minty example as

    $ python3 kleeminty.py

The output is the same as running `kleeminty.m` as `>> kleeminty(5)`.

Of course, these codes can also be run inside a Python interpreter, or an appropriately configured editor.
