## Project

Don't worry about your project until after the Midterm Exam on Friday, 28 October!  At that point I will address it in class and hand out the "About your project" document below.

  * [About your project (PDF)](assets/project/description.pdf)
  * [example LaTeX file you may use for your project (.tex)](assets/project/blank.tex) and the [PDF it produces](assets/project/blank.pdf)
  * [form I'll use to grade Part I (PDF)](assets/project/rubricI.pdf)  FIXME: needs updating; is 25 points
  * [form I'll use to grade Part II (PDF)](assets/project/rubricII.pdf)  FIXME: needs updating; is 75 points
