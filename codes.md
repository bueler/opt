## Codes

The Matlab/Octave codes below come from examples I did in lecture, or they are from the Homework solutions.  For the full Homework solutions go to the [Canvas course page](https://canvas.alaska.edu/courses/21663).

<!--
  * [.m](assets/codes/F24/.m)
-->

  * [testnewtsafe.m](assets/codes/F24/testnewtsafe.m)
  * [newtsafe.m](assets/codes/F24/newtsafe.m)  (calls [bt.m](assets/codes/F24/bt.m))
  * [newtsec.m](assets/codes/F24/newtsec.m)
  * [POPDIP](https://github.com/bueler/popdip) is my fairly-polished-by-now class project.  It lives it its own Github repository.  It implements a primal-dual interior point method, from section 16.7 of our textbook (Griva, Nash, & Sofer 2009).  To try the Matlab/Octave code you should either [clone the popdip repository](https://github.com/bueler/popdip) or [download a .zip release](https://github.com/bueler/popdip/releases/tag/v1.2).  Either way you will get the codes, [documentation](https://github.com/bueler/popdip/blob/main/doc.pdf), and [slides](https://github.com/bueler/popdip/blob/main/slides.pdf).
  * These four codes go with my [slides on why steepest descent needs help](assets/slides/F24/sdneedshelp.pdf):
      1. [sdbtrecord.m](assets/codes/F24/sdbtrecord.m)
      2. [sdbt.m](assets/codes/F24/sdbt.m)
      3. [easyq.m](assets/codes/F24/easyq.m)
      4. [bt.m](assets/codes/F24/bt.m)
  * [salmon.m](assets/codes/F24/salmon.m)
  * [phaseone.m](assets/codes/F24/phaseone.m)
  * The simplex method bundle [simplex.zip](assets/codes/F24/simplex.zip) also includes Python3 versions written by Kaelin Ellis; see the `py-simplex/` subdirectory when you extract.
  * Simplex method bundle (all 7 `.m` codes are in [simplex.zip](assets/codes/F24/simplex.zip)):
      1. [sfsimplex.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/sfsimplex.m)
      2. [ezsimplex.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/ezsimplex.m)
      3. [myexSF.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/myexSF.m)
      4. [myexEZ.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/myexEZ.m)
      5. [bookexSF.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/bookexSF.m)
      6. [bookexEZ.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/bookexEZ.m)
      7. [kleeminty.m](assets/codes/F24/simplex/kleeminty.m)
  * [nullmat.m](assets/codes/F24/nullmat.m)
  * [ratiotest.m](assets/codes/F24/ratiotest.m)
  * [calc_brute.m](assets/codes/F24/calc_brute.m)
  * [calc_bisection.m](assets/codes/F24/calc_bisection.m)
  * [calc_golden.m](assets/codes/F24/calc_golden.m)
  * [calc_newton.m](assets/codes/F24/calc_newton.m)
  * [fit.m](assets/codes/F24/fit.m)
